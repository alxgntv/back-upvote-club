    "q": "Is it safe to get Twitter likes from Upvote Club?",
    "a": "Yes, it's totally safe. You'll only receive likes from real Twitter users — no bots, no fake accounts, no risks."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need to give you my Twitter password?",
    "a": "Never. We don't need your password or access to your account. Just drop a tweet link — that's it."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will Twitter ban my account for this?",
    "a": "No, using Upvote Club won't get you banned. Our method is community-driven and doesn't break any of Twitter's rules."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is it really free?",
    "a": "Yes! You can get 5 free likes on your tweet without paying anything. It's a great way to try the system and see how it works. Later, if you want faster or bigger results, you can unlock more features with paid plans — but getting started costs nothing."
  },
  {
    "q": "How fast will I get the likes on my tweet?",
    "a": "You'll usually start seeing likes within minutes — especially if you post your tweet and share it during the \"golden hour\" (the first hour after posting). That's when Twitter's algorithm is most sensitive to early engagement, and it helps your tweet gain more reach. The faster you create your task after publishing, the more impact it has."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most effective way to grow on Twitter?",
    "a": "The key is consistent posting and strong early engagement — likes, comments, and reposts. That's exactly what Upvote Club helps you with."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are these real people?",
    "a": "Yes. Every like comes from a real Twitter account. Our community includes indie makers, startup founders, engineers, designers, marketers, and creators who actively use the platform. We actively ban bots if they are found."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why do you say you have no bots for Twitter?",
    "a": "Because we don't. Upvote Club is a peer-based community where users help each other grow — not a farm of fake accounts."
